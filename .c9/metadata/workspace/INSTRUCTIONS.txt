The id will be used in the second program to retrieve the corresponding record. This program should keep taking inputs until the user types \"y\" in response to Quit.  Immediately before the quit prompt is printed each time, the newly obtained record must be written to a file named \"students\" under the current directory.  Phone number should be checked for only digits, spaces and dashes. Name should only be letters (caps allowed).  The data structure to be used in this exercise (taken from specs of lab 4):","typedef struct student {","char name[32];","char phone[16];","char address[128];","} student_t;","You must add the ID field to the above struct.
