Write an interactive program on Linux, that creates a “keyed” file.
This program reads student records (name, phone, address) from standard input, 
and returns a unique id for each record. 
The id will be used in the second program to retrieve the corresponding record.
This program should keep taking inputs until the user types "y" in response to Quit.
Immediately before the quit prompt is printed each time,
the newly obtained record must be written to a file named "students" under the current directory. 
Phone number should be checked for only digits, spaces and dashes. Name should only be letters (caps allowed). 

The data structure to be used in this exercise (taken from specs of lab 4):
typedef struct student {
char name[32];
char phone[16];
char address[128];
} student_t;

You must add the ID field to the above struct. Preferably before the name field.

Here is a sample run:
Name >> John
Phone >> 101 555 1001
Address >> Anywhere
Record Created with id: 0
Quit(y/n)? >> n

Name >> ...

Only the content of the struct is written to the “directory”.  
Records will NOT be overwritten.  
If a name is already in the directory, 
prompt the user: “Is this a new entry?” and if yes, add it to the file, 
otherwise prompt with “duplicate ignored” and request another entry.

NOTE: You will use the output of this lab to create the input for the next lab.
